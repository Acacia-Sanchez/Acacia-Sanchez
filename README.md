# Hi there, I'm Acacia SÃ¡nchez ðŸ‘‹

## A senior with a junior's passion for learning! ðŸ˜„

<h3>NOWADAYS</h3>
<h4> Having missed the coding life, I am now participating in an intense bootcamp with [FactorÃ­a F5](https://factoriaf5.org), focusing on Backend development.</h4>

<h3>PAST EXPERIENCE </h3>
<p> <strong> PROGRAMMING </strong> </p>
<p> I have some knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3, as well as experience with Wordpress, Elementor, Crocoblock, and various plugins. You can visit the website www.elarco.es, which I created four years ago during my free time, while learning everything on my own./p>
<p> After completing my FP-2 studies in 1992, I spent a few months programming in Clipper.</p>

<p> <strong> NOT ONLY PROGRAMMING...  </strong> </p>
<p> For a few years, life took me down the microsystems path, where I worked in maintenance (hardware, software, and coaxial BNC networks, including Novell Netware). </p>
<p> I've been involved in computing for a long time (I got my first computer in 1990!). This early start gave me the opportunity to learn a great deal about computers and operating systems (MS-DOS, Windows from version 3.1). </p>


<h3>LANGUAGES</h3>
<p> I consider my English to be quite good, likely around a B2 level. Iâ€™ll be taking the test soon and hope to sit the Cambridge exam in a few months. </p>
<p> I also have basic knowledge of French and would love to improve it in the future. </p>
